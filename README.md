# Team OnlyVibeCoding - IUT Hackathon 2025

## Project Overview
Our project, developed by Team OnlyVibeCoding for the IUT Hackathon 2025, is a **Buying and Selling platform** designed specifically for students. The platform facilitates the exchange of used goods among students, offering a unique blend of student identity verification, communication features, AI integration, and scalable infrastructure. This platform addresses the needs of students who want to buy or sell used items within a secure and trusted environment.

## Key Features

### 1) Student Identity & Verification
To ensure the authenticity of users, we have implemented a rigorous student identity and verification process. This includes:
- **University Email Check**: We verify each user's identity by cross-checking their university email, ensuring that only registered students can participate in the platform.
- **Detailed Academic Profiles**: Each student has a verified academic profile that is tied to their university status, helping build trust within the platform.
- **Private Info**: We respect privacy by securing all sensitive data and ensuring that private information is visible only to the relevant parties.

### 2) Listings and Discovery
Our platform makes listing and discovering items simple and flexible:
- **Diverse Listing Types**: Users can list a wide range of items, from textbooks to electronics, catering to all student needs.
- **Flexible Pricing Options**: Sellers can set their own prices, including the option to allow for negotiations.
- **Controlled Visibility Modes**: Listings can be set to different visibility levels (public, private, or restricted) depending on user preference.
- **Advanced Search and Filtering**: A powerful search engine allows users to filter listings based on categories, price, condition, and other important factors, making it easy to find what they're looking for.

### 3) Real-Time Communication
Communication between buyers and sellers is made seamless with real-time chat features:
- **Buyer-Seller Chat**: A direct, secure chat interface allows buyers and sellers to discuss details in real-time.
- **Image Sharing in Chat**: Users can share images of items directly in the chat, ensuring clear communication about the product condition and quality.
- **Integration of Map in Chat**: For in-person exchanges, the chat integrates with maps to suggest safe meeting spots, enhancing security and convenience.

### 4) Student Admin Driven Moderation
The platform includes robust admin features to ensure safe and fair interactions:
- **Admin Moderation**: Student admins have the ability to monitor listings, approve or reject items, and manage disputes, ensuring the platform remains free of fraud and scams.
- **Reporting Tools**: Users can report inappropriate listings or behavior, which will be handled by admins promptly.

### 5) AI Features
We have integrated AI to enhance the user experience and streamline the buying and selling process:
- **Price Advising Using AI**: Our AI-driven system can advise users on the best price for their items, taking into account market trends and demand.
- **Smart Chatbot for Suggesting Best Fit Goods**: The AI chatbot recommends relevant items to users based on their preferences and search history, making shopping more personalized and efficient.

### 6) Scalable Infrastructure
The platform is built with scalability in mind:
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Our backend is designed for seamless scalability, capable of handling an increasing number of users as the platform grows. This ensures smooth performance even as the platform expands.
- **Optimized for Web Hosting**: The platform is optimized for deployment on web servers, ensuring fast loading times and high availability.

### 7) Social Media Login
To streamline the user experience, we offer social media login options:
- **Social Media Integration**: Users can log in to the platform using their social media accounts, such as Facebook or Google, reducing barriers to entry and simplifying the registration process.

## Conclusion
Team OnlyVibeCodingâ€™s project aims to provide a secure, efficient, and student-friendly platform for buying and selling used goods. By combining real-time communication, AI integration, and a scalable infrastructure, we have created a platform that meets the unique needs of students. Our focus on student identity verification and safety ensures a trustworthy environment for all users.

With plans for future improvements and feature additions, we believe our platform can revolutionize how students exchange goods and services in a digital world.
